adv7180 driver for iMX6
=======================

This is a modified form of the adv7180 driver found in the Freescale/NXP 3.14 
kernel.  

This is for the Radiodetection DVC2 board using the 32 pin variant of the 
adv7180.

Note that modern kernels have a very different adv7180 driver due to changes
in V4L2, but this older version is favoured as it is proven working with iMX6
video input interfaces.

This version of the adv7180 has the follwoing changes:

- mods to support NTSC (with the 3.14 kernel)
- analog input selection via sysfs
- selection of IPU

In addition there are changes to aid usage of the module with the Analog
Devices adv7180 evaluation board, by suppressing i2c transactions and
by forcing PAL or NTSC mode.  This is because the evaluation board allows
programming only via a USB interface, rather than i2c.

See adv7108.txt for module parameters, sysfs interface and device tree 
bindings.
